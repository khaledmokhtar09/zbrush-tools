A practical toolbox for ZBrush users. It covers core workflows for Dynamesh, PolyPaint, and ZRemesher. The goal is to speed up creation, polish, and iteration. This repository compiles tools, templates, and guidance to help artists work faster and with more consistency.

## Overview

- Dynamesh: fast topology generation for concept sculpting.  
- PolyPaint: real color painting inside the sculpting phase.  
- ZRemesher: clean topology for clean UVs and reliable refinement.  
- Templates and macros to reduce repetitive steps.  
- Clear guidance for typical project pipelines, from rough blockout to final polish.  

This toolkit is designed for practical use in a studio or personal project. It aims for reliability and simplicity. The tools are built to work with standard ZBrush features, not to replace them.

## Why this toolkit helps

- You save time on common tasks.  
- You keep a consistent workflow from project to project.  
- You reduce errors in topology and painting stages.  
- You can adapt the templates to your own brands or styles.  
- The approach emphasizes clarity and repeatability.

## What’s included

- Dynamesh helpers: quick cleanup passes, edge flows, and retopology shortcuts.  
- PolyPaint utilities: color management, layer organization, and color transfer tricks.  
- ZRemesher guides: step-by-step plans for clean topology with different target outcomes.  
- Project templates: starter files for common genres like characters, creatures, and props.  
- Shortcuts and macros: scripts that automate repetitive sequences.  

Note: This repo focuses on practical tools you can apply right away. It does not replace core ZBrush features. It complements them.

## How it works

- The toolkit provides a set of ready-to-run assets and templates.  
- It adds lightweight automation to speed up common steps.  
- It emphasizes predictable results and minimal friction.  
- It is implemented with a mix of macros and document templates designed for ZBrush workflows.

## Getting started

Prerequisites
- ZBrush version compatible with the tools (verify in the Releases section).  
- Basic knowledge of Dynamesh, PolyPaint, and ZRemesher.  
- A computer that meets ZBrush requirements.  
- An understanding of project goals and asset specs.

First steps
- Visit the Releases page to download the appropriate assets. From the releases page, download the installer or asset file and run it. The release assets contain ready-to-use files and instructions for setup.  
- Unpack or install according to the installer prompts.  
- Open ZBrush and verify the tool panels appear in the expected places.  
- Load a test model and try a few of the presets to see how the workflow behaves.

Where to download
- You can access the releases page here: https://github.com/khaledmokhtar09/zbrush-tools/releases. This page hosts installable assets and sample files. If you need a starting point, download the recommended asset and run it. You will see a guided setup and a short tutorial.  
- For quick access, you can click the badge at the top of this file to jump to the releases page.

Releases page notes
- The releases page contains versioned assets. Each release includes notes that describe what changed and how to use the assets. It may include installation instructions, caveats, and known issues.  
- If you encounter problems, check the Release Notes. They explain compatibility and required steps. If a file is missing, check the later releases or the repository’s issues for guidance.

## Installation and setup

1) Download the release asset from the Releases page. The asset may be an installer, a zip, or a plugin package.  
2) Run the installer or unpack the archive.  
3) Follow the on-screen prompts. This usually includes agreeing to the terms, choosing a destination, and confirming the installation.  
4) Launch ZBrush. The new tools should appear in the tool palette or a dedicated tab.  
5) If you see any errors, recheck the requirements and verify you downloaded the correct asset for your OS and ZBrush version.  
6) Optional: import any starter files or templates included in the release.

Tips for a smooth install
- Use the version recommended in the release notes.  
- Back up your ZBrush settings before installing.  
- If you use multiple machines, keep a copy of the templates with your project files.

## Quick start guide

- Open ZBrush and load the Dynamesh starter project.  
- Use the Dynamesh helper to create a base form quickly.  
- Switch to PolyPaint to lay down base colors and quick shading.  
- Use ZRemesher guides to generate clean topology for the final model.  
- Save a versioned file after each major step to track progress.

Step-by-step example
- Start with a rough blockout. Use Dynamesh to fill in topology.  
- Add color with PolyPaint while the mesh remains flexible.  
- When the form is stable, apply ZRemesher guidance to optimize topology.  
- Repaint or adjust colors after remeshing to restore or refine texture details.  
- Review edge flows and silhouette. Iterate as needed.

## How to use the tools

- Dynamesh: Generate geometry, then refine edges and volume. Focus on maintaining primary forms.  
- PolyPaint: Paint directly on the mesh, using masking and layers to separate areas.  
- ZRemesher: Create clean topology that supports future detailing and UV mapping.  
- Macros: Run sequences that combine multiple steps. They reduce repetitive work and ensure consistency.

Best practices
- Work with a non-destructive mindset where possible. Keep backup copies.  
- Start with broad blocks, then refine details in later passes.  
- Keep geometry density as low as possible before remeshing.  
- Use color blocks to plan textures early, then refine texture maps later.

## Tutorials and demonstrations

- Setup tutorial: a walk-through of installing the assets and configuring ZBrush to recognize them.  
- Dynamesh workflow tutorial: from initial mesh to a finished base model with clean topology.  
- PolyPaint painting workflow: how to layer colors, manage palettes, and prepare textures for export.  
- ZRemesher optimization: strategies to preserve shapes while simplifying topology.  
- Material and shader tips: how to integrate the provided templates with standard shading.  

Each tutorial uses concrete steps and screenshots to illustrate the process. The goal is to show how the tools fit into real-world sculpting tasks.

## Workflows and use cases

- Character creation: use Dynamesh for initial form, PolyPaint for color blocking, then ZRemesher for clean topology.  
- Creature design: rapid iteration with Dynamesh, followed by precise topology with ZRemesher.  
- Props and accessories: maintain shape while optimizing polys for animation or printing.  
- Creature anatomy: align topology to anatomy guides for natural movement.  

Advanced workflows
- Hybrid topology: combine Dynamesh blocks with remeshed regions to keep strong shapes where needed.  
- Detail layering: paint base colors first, then add textures and bump details.  
- UV preparation: use the ZRemesher output as a basis for UV maps, followed by texture baking.

## Visual references and inspiration

- A gallery of sculptures created with ZBrush, showing how Dynamesh, PolyPaint, and ZRemesher combine for fast concepting and final polish.  
- Concept art and study references to help plan anatomy, proportion, and silhouette.  
- A showcase of color palettes that work well with digital skin, metal, or organic textures.

## Performance and optimization

- Larger projects can demand significant memory. Use Dynamesh in moderate resolutions while experimenting.  
- Keep a clean topology to reduce shading and rendering overhead.  
- Use remeshing strategically to avoid unnecessary geometry while preserving the form.  
- Profile your workflow to identify bottlenecks and adjust the asset density.

## Compatibility and requirements

- Works best with ZBrush versions common in professional pipelines.  
- Ensure your hardware meets ZBrush recommendations for memory and processing power.  
- Some assets may be platform-specific (Windows or macOS). Check the release notes for details.

## Troubleshooting

- If the tools don’t appear in ZBrush, verify the installation path and ensure the correct asset is loaded.  
- If the UI is slow, reduce the density before remeshing and optimize texture sizes.  
- If colors look off after remeshing, reapply PolyPaint or recalculate color maps.  
- If a tutorial is unclear, consult the release notes for additional context.
